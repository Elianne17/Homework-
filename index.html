      <p class="paragraph">In case you ask, my name means daughter of the sun. Yes, I have another name,<br>but I don´t feel like saying it.   You can call me Eli, or it´s pronounce as   it´s read. <br><br> Since i was ten years old the music was an important part of my life so, I learn how to play the drums, guitar, and keyboards. I´m pretty bad at singing. Basically, thats why I studied audio engineer. <br><br> </p>
      <p class="paragraph2">The thing I enjoy the most, is making documentaries, about the music I love, people that inspire me and the odds around Mexico city </p>
